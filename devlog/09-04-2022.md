Lol I updated it and it sucks (error)... you write shit code Jacob

I'm really spent right now but I'll poke at this.

Ate a lot of shit food, feel lethargic

Well that's not good, any repo scrapers got the names of my debts! ha

I'm already f'd anyway due to data breaches

It is interesting though, I was supposed to put down $800 in this pay period but I actually subtracted from that by $400 or so dang...

Slow escape

8:55 PM

it's still wrong

I'll figure this out tomorrow
