late start today

I have seen in a few places not to use Google Spreadsheet as a database but it's useful for me.

I feel a sense of calm tabulating my expenses, knowing where I am budget wise.

The work I'll add today is a local API that the front-end can hit to sync the values automatically into this app vs. manual input.

Right now I'm pretty much typing the data twice, I look at my accounts (tried to [automate this](https://github.com/jdc-cunningham/improved-automated-browser-finance-app-logins) but failed) and enter the values into the spreadsheet.

Then copy the spreadsheet values into this local storage interface.

I've done this work before in other projects... just pull the spreadsheet accessor, pull the latest row and dump them into the interface.

I'll need to anonymously map the values though based on the local storage entries.

I gotta remember how this thing is structured

What should happen is:

- hit sync button
- pull latest row in spreadsheet
- enter those rows into interface
- refresh page and show the update on left side

Have a couple of keys

OMG I forgot about this stupid structure I made

```
finfinite
[
  [
    {
      name: 'name', val: 'account name'
    },
    {name: 'bal', val: '14036.31'},
    {name: 'apr', val: '10.45'},
    {name: 'dueDay', val: ''},
    {name: 'minPay', val: ''},
    {name: 'id', val: 1658003705822}
  ]
]
```

```
finfinite_balance_change
{
  accountName: [
    {
      tiemstamp: ...,
      balance: ...
    }
  ]
}
```

Ahh man losing focus and I just started lol, get the pieces to work

11:47 AM

that nasty hack code

what's tough/sketch is the columns in spreadsheet are mapped by number based on current `localStorage` state... since I don't want to divulge the account names on this frontend

12:18 PM

this balance math is weird... it's diffing between prev balance and current... then I guess it sums them... hmm

1:09 PM

super nasty code but it works, tested... all I gotta do is put up an API on my local server PI and it'll just be running all the time

oh no... probably get an HTTPS issue if it's not hosted somewhere due to github pages dang

hmm... I have a few VPSs... ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

hmm hmmm... just means whatever domain I put on the front end will be public which is whatever, have burner domains but yeah
