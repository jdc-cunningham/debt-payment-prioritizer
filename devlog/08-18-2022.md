Let me see if I can add this feature... I think I can.

What I want "is a way to feel good" as in I can see my progress.

So how would that happen? Everytime I update the values, I usually update them all at once.

An easy thing to do is to just diff the values by storing them with a date.

Using the debt's balance and interest, I can see what I saved by removing that amount.

Of course what's the time part then... I could just do like monthly.

That seems to be roughly what I can do in terms of payments anyway (once a month).

I gotta draw this out briefly and think about it.

I'll leave most of the existing code alone and just tack this on, on the post-edit events.

I'm doing my spreadsheet diffing to help figure out what to code

I should note this is not super accurate because the time I fill this out is probably not the time I actually pay but it's gamifying the feels.

Yeah I think I got how this will work.

It'll take the change and multiply it with the interest/time elapsed between the two times as the money saved interest growth wise.

Easiest thing to diff is Date.now() but then you have to convert that to interest seconds...

lol it's 38 dollars ooh

Ehh... I'll include the principal that I paid too, maximimize the feels

I can't code anything now but I can probably knock this out tomorrow.
